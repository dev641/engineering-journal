summary: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated. It is used as a base class and may contains one or more abstract methods (method without implementation).

# Abstract Class

## Detailed Explanation

- Abstract classes allow **0-100%** abstraction.
  - They can have only abstract mthods (100% abstraction).
  - They can also have mix of abstract and concrete methods.
- A concrete sub classes that extends an abstract class must provide implementation of all the inherited abstract methods.
- Abstract classes are extended (not implemented) by subclasses, using the `extends` keyword.
- Objects cannot be created directly from an abstract class (`new` is not allowed).
- Abstract class references, however, can store instances of sub classes.
- Abstract classes support constructors, fields, and access modifiers just like normal classes.

## Code Example

```
// Abstract base class
abstract class Car {
	abstract void applyBrakes(); // Abstract method (No implementation)
	void accerate() {
		System.out.println("Car is accelerating...");
	}
}

// Concreate subclass
class Audi extends Car {
	@Override
	void applyBrakes () {
		System.out.println("Audi brake applied!!...");
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Car myCar = new Car(); // ❌Not Allowed
		Car myCar = new Audi(); // ✅ Allowed: reference of abstract, object of concrete
		myCar.accelerate();
		myCar.applyBrakes();

	}
}
```

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Framework Base Classes**: Many frameworks (like Spring or Android SDK) use abstract base classes that provide default implementation for common metgods and enforce subclasses to implement specific methods.
- **Example**: `HttpServlet` in Java EE - developers extends it and implement only the method needed (`doGet`,`doPost`).

## Key Takeaways

- Declared with `abstract` keyword.
- Cannot be instantiated.
- Achieve **partial abstraction**.
- Subclasses must implement all abstract methods
- Abstract references can store subclass objects.
